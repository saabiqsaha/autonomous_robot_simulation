# 3D Visualization Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the optimizations made to improve the loading time and rendering performance of the 3D warehouse robot simulation visualization.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Shadow Rendering

- Reduced shadow map resolution from 2048x2048 to 1024x1024 by default
- Added adaptive shadow resolution based on performance mode (512x512 for low, 1024x1024 for balanced, 2048x2048 for high)
- Limited shadow casting to only important objects
- Made fill lights non-shadow casting
- Added option to disable shadows completely

### 2. Geometry Optimizations

- Reduced grid size and divisions from 100 to 50
- Decreased geometry detail for common objects:
  - Wheels: Reduced cylinder segments from 16 to 8
  - Sensors: Reduced sphere segments from 16x8 to 8x4
  - Task markers: Reduced segment counts by ~50%
- Implemented shared geometry for similar objects (racks, obstacles, items)
- Limited the number of rendered objects:
  - Max 50 items
  - Max 30 racks
  - Max 20 obstacles

### 3. Renderer Optimizations

- Set `powerPreference: 'high-performance'` in renderer options
- Limited pixel ratio based on device capabilities
- Added adaptive quality settings (low, balanced, high)
- Replaced point lights with emissive materials for charging stations

### 4. Resource Management

- Implemented proper disposal of geometries and materials
- Added shared geometry caching system to reduce memory usage
- Added a complete cleanup function to dispose unused resources

### 5. Loading Process

- Added staged loading with visual progress indicators
- Split initialization process into manageable chunks
- Added loading time measurement and reporting

### 6. Performance Monitoring and Controls

- Integrated Stats.js for real-time performance monitoring
- Added user-configurable performance options panel
- Created performance modes (low, balanced, high)
- Added simplified view mode for very low-end devices

### 7. View Optimization Techniques

- Implemented level-of-detail (LOD) rendering based on camera distance
- Added frustum culling to avoid rendering objects outside the camera view
- Simplified materials for distant objects

## Performance Mode Comparison

| Feature | Low Mode | Balanced Mode | High Mode |
|---------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Pixel Ratio | 1 | 1.5 (max) | Device native |
| Shadow Map Size | 512x512 | 1024x1024 | 2048x2048 |
| Shadow Casting | Limited | Standard | Full |
| Max Objects | Heavily limited | Limited | Standard |
| Geometry Detail | Minimal | Reduced | Standard |

## Simplified View Mode

The simplified view mode provides a significant performance boost by:

1. Disabling all shadows
2. Converting all materials to basic, non-PBR materials
3. Setting pixel ratio to minimum
4. Disabling post-processing effects

## Usage Guidelines

For best performance:

1. Use balanced mode on most systems
2. Enable simplified view on low-end devices or when experiencing lag
3. Consider disabling shadows on mobile devices
4. Limit the number of simultaneous tasks to reduce marker rendering

## Measuring Performance

1. Enable the performance monitor to view FPS (frames per second)
2. Check the loading time reported in the console
3. Monitor for frame drops during camera movement

## Further Optimization Opportunities

1. Implement instanced rendering for identical objects
2. Add occlusion culling to avoid rendering hidden objects
3. Use texture atlases to reduce draw calls
4. Implement WebGL2 features when available
5. Add resolution scaling option for high-DPI displays
